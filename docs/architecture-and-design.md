# Architecture and Desing in general

Architecture in this repository embraces a monorepo approach housed within a single, unified repository.
Despite the widespread adoption of microservices and distributed systems, decision to maintain a monorepo structure is intentional
and driven by the pursuit of learning and simplicity.

**Key Aspects:**

* **Learning Focus:** The choice to keep all components, including multiple APIs, Ocelot API Gateway, Aggregator, Web App, RabbitMQ, and more, within one repository is deliberate.
It allows for a focused exploration of various techniques and technologies in a cohesive environment.

* **Simplified Management:** Having all components in a single repository simplifies the management and coordination of the entire system.
This setup facilitates a comprehensive understanding of the interactions between different parts of the architecture.

* **Holistic Development Experience:** Developers working within the monorepo benefit from a holistic development experience.
Changes and updates can be applied uniformly across all components, streamlining the development process.

* **Consolidated Learning:** By choosing a monorepo, learning efforts within a singular context is consolidated.
This approach allows for a deeper understanding of the intricacies of each component and their interactions.

While the industry trend often leans towards microservices and distributed architectures, our intentional embrace of a monorepo structure serves as a valuable learning exercise.
It provides a controlled environment for experimenting with various techniques and technologies, fostering a comprehensive understanding of our system's intricacies.

## Software Architecture vs Software Design

Let's focus on two key aspects "software design" and "software architecture" which are related but represent different aspects of the software development process.

**Software Design:**
Focus: Software design is primarily concerned with the detailed specifications of how a system or application will be implemented.
It involves making decisions about individual modules, classes, and functions, including their structure, behavior, and interactions.

Scope: Design decisions at this level often involve low-level considerations such as algorithms, data structures, and the internal workings of specific components.
It is more about the "how" of implementation within a specific module or class.

**Software Architecture:**
Focus: Software architecture, on the other hand, has a broader focus.
It is concerned with the overall structure of a software system, including high-level design decisions that dictate how various components will interact.
It addresses the organization of the entire system.

Scope: Architectural decisions encompass components, their relationships, and the overall layout of the system.
It often involves choosing patterns, frameworks, and defining the major building blocks of the application.

In summary, software design deals with the detailed design decisions within individual components,
while software architecture addresses the high-level structure and organization of the entire software system.
Both are crucial aspects of the software development process, and understanding the distinction can help in effective communication and collaboration within development teams.
