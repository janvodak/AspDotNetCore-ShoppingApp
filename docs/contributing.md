## Repository Settings and Best Practices

1. Git Strategy - Streamline Workflow:
In this repository, we follow the Streamline Workflow as our Git strategy.
This approach encourages a linear and simplified version control process, making it easier to manage changes and releases.
1. Signed Commits:
To maintain a high level of code integrity and traceability, all commits made to this repository must be signed. This ensures that each change is associated with a verified author.
1. Pull Requests and Code Reviews:
We adhere to a strict pull request-based development process. Every change, whether it's a bug fix, feature, or hotfix, must be submitted as a pull request (PR).
Before merging, each PR undergoes a thorough code review by one or more team members to maintain code quality and catch potential issues.
1. Require Conversation Resolution Before Merging:
To promote effective communication and collaboration, we require that all conversations (comments, discussions, and feedback) within a PR must be resolved before the PR can be merged.
This ensures that no important feedback or concerns are left unaddressed.
1. Require Status Checks to Pass Before Merging:
Before a PR can be merged, it must pass a set of defined status checks. These checks may include automated tests, code quality checks, and other validation processes.
This ensures that changes meet the defined quality standards and do not introduce regressions.
1. Branch Management:
To keep our repository organized and maintain a clear branching strategy, we only allow specific branches:
	* **feature**: Feature branches are used for developing new features or enhancements. They are created based on the `main` branch.
	* **hotfix**: Hotfix branches are used for addressing critical issues or bugs in production. They are created based on the `main` branch.
	* **release**: Release branches are created when preparing for a new release. They are based on the `main` branch and serve as a stabilization phase before deployment.
	* **main**: The `main` branch represents the stable production-ready codebase. All changes flow into this branch through pull requests.
By following these GitHub settings and best practices, we aim to maintain a structured and collaborative development process that ensures code quality, security, and a smooth release cycle for our project.
